The door of Blissful Healing Spa creaked open as Ken, a young man of 20, stepped inside, his nerves tingling with anticipation. A faint aroma of lavender and eucalyptus drifted through the air, soothing his senses. He glanced around, taking in the muted earthy tones of the walls and the dim lighting that gave the place a serene atmosphere.

Behind the reception desk, a friendly smile greeted him. The receptionist, a woman with a kind, inviting face, welcomed him and confirmed his appointment. She handed him a robe and informed him that Elvra, the masseuse, would be with him shortly.

With a nod of appreciation, Ken followed the receptionist down a dimly lit corridor, his heart pounding in his chest. The soft sound of trickling water echoed through the hallway, calming his racing thoughts. They stopped in front of a door, where the receptionist softly knocked before opening it to reveal a small, dimly lit room, the flickering glow of candles casting a warm, inviting light.

As Ken entered the massage room, he couldn't help but feel a sense of vulnerability. The space felt intimate, the scent of essential oils heavy in the air. He noticed the massage table, draped in crisp, clean linens, beckoning him to lie down and surrender to the soothing touch of the masseuse.

The receptionist left the room, gently closing the door behind her, leaving Ken alone with his thoughts. He hesitated for a moment, then slipped out of his clothes, folding them neatly on a nearby chair. Clad in just the robe, he awaited Elvra's arrival.

The sound of the door opening caught Ken's attention, and he turned to see a woman entering the room. Her dark, wavy hair framed her enigmatic face, and her eyes held a glint of mystery. She introduced herself as Elvra, the masseuse, and her voice was like a gentle caress, soothing and alluring.

Elvra's gaze seemed to linger on Ken's body, making him feel both vulnerable and excited. She instructed him to remove his robe and lie down on the massage table, face down. As Ken obeyed, he felt the cool, soft sheets against his skin, and a shiver ran through him. Elvra watched him intently, her eyes studying his every move, as if seeking to understand the essence of his being.

Once Ken was in position, Elvra approached the table, carrying a bottle of oil. She poured a small amount of the fragrant liquid into her hands, the scent of jasmine and sandalwood filling the air. She rubbed her palms together, warming the oil, and Ken couldn't help but anticipate her touch.

Elvra concentrated on the pressure points at the base of Ken's skull, on the back of his neck, probing, searching deeply for the second vital organ, the Kundalini. She searched in between his vertebrae and behind his ears, tweaking the nerve points with her fingers. Then she explored each facial chakra as she poured oil over his body, pouring bliss into his being.

Ken's muscles seemed to melt into the sheets, and he let his mind wander, returning to the images that had plagued him since his encounter with the wild woman. He saw her face and body, the image bringing memories flooding back to his consciousness.

Shadows cast shadows over the landscape, moonlight aloft in a shining crescent. Then came a bright, white moon that filled the hole with searing fingers, piercing memories from his past, memories from the deep recesses of his mind. And the song began, a powerful delight.

Then he reached for her, touching her face and her mouth, hearing her voice, feeling the smile she knew he would give. Then the moment arrived, his arms encasing her and feeling her flesh, hearing the small moans of ecstasy as his tongue entwined with hers. More pleasure, but only as bait, to fish her new life out of the murky depths of his past, to toss and watch as she came to life one more time.

His eyes cast down, and he felt her body, the potency of her forceful stare, and he knew he was overwhelmed in body and soul. Her touch was electrifying, setting his heart dancing and committing Ken to a new place. Though he strained to draw her here, she faded before her flesh could reach his grip.

Then he reached for her again, as her voice filled his mind. Then, with his fingers lining her face, he said, "Settle down, baby girl, settle down, don't you roll no way, roll all the way, roll all the way, I'm just not ready to let you go…"

Then he lost himself in her melodic voice, his voice, drumming to the call of the wind, lost in the sound of the song, lost to its lush pulsating song, letting it wash over him, take him. Within the scream of compassion, he surrendered his body, surrendered to this woman and her lyrics, called to release a flood of emotion.

Moments later, he felt the grit of the woman's mask jab his eye, and then saw the flash of yellow as the woman's smile came to life. He saw the wide eyes begin to harden, her eyes growing dark, hard, and stranger still, there remained a fear of a heightened awareness, as though somehow their encounter had crossed the thin boundaries between what her species deemed was right and wrong.

"Oh babe," she said, the conviction in her voice jarring him. "You make my life an empty dead hole. I've been waiting for you to come along, waiting to breathe in your hot ass, waiting for my name to be on your lips…oh, here, here it comes, here come the muthafuckin' lips…"

But she was not finishing, something was missing. As the ending came, he felt as though the last notes lingered unimpeded in sorrow, merely hinted at the terrible truth he planned and received. Then, just as the song began to fade, and the last notes came to life in mind, he felt the terror suddenly descend on his body, taking him physically, tossing him about in a violent crash, shaking his mind and soul. And he went back to sleep, to sweat and dream again.

Ken awoke and saw Elvra looking at him, her eyes mischievous, a concerned look on her face and on her face was the irony of life streaming down her face.

"I apologize, dear," she said softly, "I didn't want to ruffle your feathers."

Ken's subconscious mind must have triggered his need to dream and had forgotten to sleep. With her word, Elvra began massaging his body, rubbing the tips of her fingers gently down the back of his neck. Ken felt the oil as she poured it on his exposed back, lifting his skin, sifting through all his senses. He clenched his jaw and tried to relax as his eyes closed, relaxing and surrendering to her point of contact.

Though Ken slept during the massage, he felt regressed as she teasingly massaged his inner thighs and along the back of his limbs. He felt like a chewed treat, her fingers exploring each nook of his consciousness. On one level, he wanted to be tender, but on another level he thought this woman would go too far, that he'd feel violated, or worse.

As they talked, Ken remembered the dream and thought a sense of dread began to build in his stomach. This made him think of the sensation he began feeling when screaming inside, falling to the ground within the mad woman's dark home. He was dreading another encounter. For every thing he would scream, a worse image would capture his mind, consequently affecting him emotionally.

The night quickly slipped by, and Ken found himself feeling numb, empty, somehow blue. But the massage was helping, and he was content to lie back and relax as a roller coaster of emotion left him reassured.





Chapter Twelve





Friday

at least Dawn thought it was Friday as she reflected on the dream from the night before. She hadn't slept so well in…she wasn't sure when.

Her mom still hadn't called or returned her last message. And as for her mom's parents, Dawn noticed the newspaper clutched in her uncle's hand, "Suppose this is what the rest of the family is saying."

Dawn couldn't argue with any of the negativity. She had resigned herself to just wait, to see what would happen. Not relaxing on the couch at all had left her with a headache. It wasn't going to be one of those "I need some quiet time" headaches but one that just made her unfocused. Dawn sat on the sofa and stared in front of the TV.

Settling down with a small smile, the funny things she coped with. The camera panned over the news room, revealing the weatherman than writing his next piece on the TV. As the fresh air stirred her hair, the warm air forced itself on her skin. She kicked off her shoes as the story of the homeless guy who was arrested for murder flashed across the screen. She knew he had lied to get in the door. What everybody forgot is that Dawn qualified as "the vulnerable". Everyone was always ready to demonize anyone who lacked a solid background. She decided she needed to say a little goodbye to her stamping ground.

A little piece of her heart wondered how many people had benefited from the unfortunate situation, including Tom, the guy killed by the policeman. If they had been in touch as friends, what would he say? In recovery, kids are given many rules
